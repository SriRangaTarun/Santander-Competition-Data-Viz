# Santander-Competition-Data-Viz
My work on visualizing the data in the [Santander Customer Transaction Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction) on Kaggle. I use simple distribution plots (kde-plots) and heatmaps in seaborn
to visualize the distribution of the variables (features) and their relationships with the target.
